      "lyric": "Everybody loves the things you do\nFrom the way you talk to the way you move\n\nEverybody here is watching you\n'Cause you feel like home\nYou're like a dream come true\n\nBut if by chance you're here alone\nCan I have a moment before I go?\n'Cause I've been by myself all night long\nHoping you're someone I used to know\n\nYou look like a movie\nYou sound like a song\nMy God, this reminds me\nOf when we were young\n\nLet me photograph you in this light\nIn case it is the last time\nThat we might be exactly like we were\nBefore we realized\nWe were sad of getting old\nIt made us restless\nIt was just like a movie\nIt was just like a song\n\nI was so scared to face my fears\nNobody told me that you'd be here\nAnd I swear you moved overseas\nThat's what you said, when you left me\n\nYou still look like a movie\nYou still sound like a song\nMy God, this reminds me\nOf when we were young\n\nLet me photograph you in this light\nIn case it is the last time\nThat we might be exactly like we were\nBefore we realized\nWe were sad of getting old\nIt made us restless\nIt was just like a movie\nIt was just like a song\n\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\n\nIt's hard to admit that\nEverything just takes me back\nTo when you were there\nTo when you were there\nAnd a part of me keeps holding on\nJust in case it hasn't gone\nI guess I still care\nDo you still care?\n\nIt was just like a movie\nIt was just like a song\nMy God, this reminds me\nOf when we were young\n\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\nWhen we were young\n\nLet me photograph you in this light\nIn case it is the last time\nThat we might be exactly like we were\nBefore we realized\nWe were sad of getting old\nIt made us restless\nOh I'm so mad I'm getting old\nIt makes me reckless\nIt was just like a movie\nIt was just like a song\nWhen we were young\n"
